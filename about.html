        <p id="aboutMeText">Hello! I am Darah Snider.
          I'm a graphic designer venturing into web development and UX/UI. I illustrate, animate, and I am generally psyched to be working on anything creative. 
          I started making digital art in Photoshop when CS5 was released. If you know how long ago that was, then you know how long ago that was... 
          I earned a Bachelor of Science in digital media arts with an emphasis in animation. It was a communications program with creative software training, fine art, and filmmaking. Since then I've also completed an intensive UX/UI bootcamp where I earned a 4.0 and a certification as a Web Professional in User Interface Design (CIW).
          I have experience in digital and print media, social media content cultivation and management, proposal writing, marketing, logo design, project management, and user feedback. My industries include real estate/property management, digital and print media, retail sales, advertisement, and volunteer non-profit work. 
          When I'm not creating something from my mind's eye, I am hanging with my husband and our 3 kiddos. I enjoy Animal Crossing, singing Hamilton off-key, RPG tabletop games (I'm looking at you D&D), podcasts and TikTok. I'm always trying new recipes and vicariously playing Jeopardy on TV. 
          If you'd like to learn more, contact me! I'm an open book.
          Oh, and Darah rhymes with Sarah.</p>
